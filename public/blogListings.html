				Lately getting out of the house and doing it in style has become harder and harder.  It always seems that I’m rushing to leave to make my appointments on time even if I prepare Honey Bunny’s diaper bag the night before.  For the past two months (I can’t believe Honey Bunny’s already two-months old!), I’ve been relying on classic yet confident outfits that don’t scream for attention yet are chic.

				So in thinking about combinations that would make an interesting outfits, I became attracted to the outfit above.  The studded gloves, the collar, and the texture in the tights all framed by a camel coat.  Simple yet at the same time interesting.
